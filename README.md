# URL Expander for Google Colab

This Python script is designed to expand shortened URLs to their full, original form. This technique improves safety by revealing the real destinations behind shortened URLs without depending on external link shortening services, which might be unreliable. By understanding the true destination of a link in advance, you avoid the potential risks linked with using unknown or unsecure online services.

## Features

- **Expand Shortened URLs**: Converts shortened URLs back to their full original URLs.
- **Timeout Handling**: Includes a timeout feature to avoid indefinite hanging during the URL expansion process.
- **Error Handling**: Catches and reports various errors like SSL errors, timeout errors, and general request exceptions.

## Security Aspects

Using this script is safer than directly visiting shortened URLs because:
- **Visibility of Final Destination**: It reveals the actual URL, helping to avoid potentially harmful websites.
- **Control Over Redirection**: By expanding the URL without automatic redirection, users can choose whether to visit the website.

## Using the Colab Notebook

To use the Colab notebook included in this repository:

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Follow the instructions within the notebook to paste the link.
3. Run the cells in the notebook.

The notebook is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, even for those with basic programming knowledge.
